# Machine Learning
This is the coursework of COMP4132 Advanced Topics in Machine Learning (2024-2025).

## Why do we have two GitHub repositories?
This repository aims to train and test the BERT model and the other repository aims to train and test the GPT2 model.

## How to use codes?
### 1. Spyder (Recommended)
    
1) Open the Spyder (you can open it through Anaconda).
2) Open the code file (anyone you want to run and test).
3) Install required libraries.
4) Click the green play button to run the code.
5) Wait and see the results.

### 2. VS Code

1) Open the VS Code.
2) Open the code file (anyone you want to run and test).
3) Install required libraries.
4) Run the following command in the terminal.
   
```bash
  python [file_name].py
```

Here, the [file_name] should be set to the file's real name, including _BERT_, _GPT2_ and _GPT2_generator_detector_.Â 
For instance, if you want to run the 'GPT2.py', you should input the following command:

```bash
  python GPT2.py
```

5) Wait and see the results.

## What is the structure of this repository?
In this repository, each code is run independently. Here is its structure.
